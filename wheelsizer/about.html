				<h1>About Wheelhub</h1>
				<p>
					A few summers ago I bought my first car, a 2003 Mitsubishi Lancer OZ Rally. It was an awesome car, but I
					needed wheels to mount the winter tires that came with it. The first set I bought were some second-hand black
					steel wheels. The center bore, width and offset were all wrong.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thanks to some help from a good friend and some research I got it right with the next set, but I wished I had
					something that could easily calculate fitment differences between wheels to make wheel shopping easier.
				</p>
                <p>
                    So, I built Wheelhub. It's a way to compare new wheels and/or tires with your car's OEM setup. You enter
                    your OEM specs, and then see in real-time how different wheel offsets, widths, and tire sizes would affect
                    your car's setup.
