				<h1>Calculator</h1>
				<p>Are you looking to upgrade your wheel &amp; tire package? Are you considering changing some
					of the properties of your wheels and/or tires?</p>
				<a href="/calculator.html"><button class="suggest"><img src="./assets/calculator.svg" class="left" style="height:20pt;" /><span>Try the<br />Calculator</span></button></a>

				<h1>Here's how it works:</h1>

				<!-- step 1 -->
				<h2>
					<div class="iconcircle current">
						<img alt="CAR" src="/assets/notepad.svg" />
					</div><span>OEM Specs</span>
				</h2>
				<p>
					Tell us what size the car's OEM wheels and tires are. You may also consider properties
					like your gear ratios or your car's wheelbase for an even more in-depth outlook on
					your new setup.
				</p>
				<img class="v_arrow" src="/assets/arrow_down.svg" />

				<!-- step 2 -->
				<h2>
					<div class="iconcircle current">
						<img alt="SETUP" src="/assets/wrench.svg" />
					</div><span>New Specs</span>
				</h2>
				<p>
					Tell us what your new setup will look like. Are you looking to try smaller wheels for the winter?
					A staggered configuration for the track? Significantly larger tires for mudding? Or maybe just as close to
					OEM as you can find for your classic car?
				</p>
				<img class="v_arrow" src="/assets/arrow_down.svg" />
			

				<!-- step 3 -->
				<h2>
					<div class="iconcircle current">
						<img alt="CALCULATOR" src="/assets/calculator.svg" />
					</div><span>Comparison</span>
				</h2>
				<p>
					Finally, it's time to pick your new setup. Play around with values like the offset, wheel width
					and tire sizes. We'll show you how it compares to your OEM setup to give you an idea of how it'll fit
					on your car in real-time.
