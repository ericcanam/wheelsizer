# Wheelhub
Wheelhub is an interactive calculator meant to help foresee changes to a vehicle's
properties when changing wheel and/or tire sizes.

## How it works
The calculator guides the user through a short series of steps:

1. The user inputs their vehicle's OEM wheel and tire specs.
2. The user configures the basics of their new setup.
3. The user is able to modify tire size, wheel width and offset on the fly, seeing
changes in real time.

Cautions and informative notes are displayed throughout the process as applicable.
